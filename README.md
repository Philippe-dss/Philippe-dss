## Hello 👋

I'm Philippe, currently working towards a PhD at Imperial College London (UK)

🔭 I’m currently working on spatial sampling effects for Type Ia Supernova analysis 🔭

🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve:
  1. general coding skills,
  2. the number of people I know in the community,
  3. how many crêpes (UK: pancakes) 🥞 I can reasonably put into a crêpe cake without it collapsing.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on general SN-Ia topics and learning more about all the surveys out there (ZTF, LSST, ...)

📫 How to reach me: through here, as I'm on a Social Media Detox™

Pronouns: he / him
